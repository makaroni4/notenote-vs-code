# notenote VS Code extension

[notenote](https://github.com/makaroni4/notenote) is a CLI tool for taking Markdown notes with VS Code.

This extension does 2 things:

1. It inserts Markdown snippets for files or images you drag & drop to your notes (you'll need to hold Shift before dropping a file into a Markdown note).
2. It copies the dropped files to your notes folder.

⚠️ This behavior :point_up: will work only for Markdown files in your notes folder.

## Installation

Install `notenote` Ruby gem: https://github.com/makaroni4/notenote#setup

It'll create your notes folder with `.vscode` config to disable default drag & drop behavior in Markdown files.
