# notenote VS Code extension :pencil:

[notenote](https://github.com/makaroni4/notenote) is a CLI tool for taking Markdown notes with VS Code.

This extension overwrites default drag & drop Markdown logic and copies dropped files to a folder with your notes.

## Installation

Install `notenote` Ruby gem: https://github.com/makaroni4/notenote#setup

It'll create your notes folder with `.vscode` config to disable default drag & drop behavior in Markdown files.
